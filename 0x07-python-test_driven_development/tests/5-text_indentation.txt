Usage
=====

Text is printed with two new lines after each of the characters `.`, `?`,
and `:`.

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("Hello?")
    Hello?
    <BLANKLINE>

No spaces are printed at the beginning of a line.

    >>> text_indentation("   Hi there.")
    Hi there.
    <BLANKLINE>

::

    >>> text_indentation("          ")

Similarly, no spaces are printed at the end of each printed line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("Hello.   ")
    Hello.
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> text_indentation("    Woah now.    This is messy.   ")
    Woah now.
    <BLANKLINE>

New lines are only printed for the characters `.`, `?`, and `:` -
text not ending with one of these characters is not ended with a new line.
